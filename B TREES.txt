B TREES

we use b trees when the complete data cannot be stored on the main memory and we need to access secondary memory in the program.
Accessing secondary memory is much more expensive than main memory. therefore we try to reduce the number of disk access as much as possible.

A b tree of order M is an M-ary tree with following properties:
1. The data items are stored at leaves.
2. The nonleaf nodes store up to M âˆ’ 1 keys to guide the searching; key i represents the
smallest key in subtree i + 1.
3. The root is either a leaf or has between two and M children.
4. All nonleaf nodes (except the root) have between M/2 and M children.
5. All leaves are at the same depth and have between L/2 and L data items, for some L
